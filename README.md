# Moty

**Tiny engine, immense model.** Pure-C LLM inference with zero runtime
dependencies: no BLAS, no Python at runtime, no GPU required. Weights load
straight from HuggingFace safetensors snapshots.

Three standalone engines, one per architecture:

| Engine | Model family | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `glm` | GLM-5.2 (744B MoE) | MLA attention, experts streamed from disk, ~25 GB RAM |
| `olmoe` | OLMoE | Reference GQA-MoE engine |
| `qwen` | Qwen3 dense / Qwen3.5 hybrid | GQA + QK-norm; Gated DeltaNet + Gated Attention |
| `gemma` | Gemma 4 (e.g. 12B-it, text-only) | Sliding/global hybrid, p-RoPE, GeGLU, SP tokenizer |

## Build

```
make            # builds all engines (from repo root or c/)
make glm        # just one engine
make portable   # portable CPU baseline (x86-64-v3 / armv8-a / power8)
make test       # test suite (GoogleTest via a separate CMake build path)
```

Requirements: a C compiler (gcc/clang) and GNU make. Linux, macOS, Windows
(MinGW/MSYS2), *BSD and PowerPC are supported. OpenMP is used when available.

The engines build with the C compiler alone. `make test` additionally needs
cmake ≥ 3.24 and a C++ compiler for the GoogleTest harness (test logic itself
is plain C; the C++ is confined to thin gtest glue). The first configure
downloads a pinned gtest via FetchContent unless a system GTest is installed.

## Docker

No toolchain on the host needed — the multi-stage `Dockerfile` builds the
portable binaries and ships a slim runtime image (debian-slim + libgomp,
all four engines in `/usr/local/bin`):

```bash
make docker                 # docker build -t moty .
make docker-test            # runs the full gtest suite INSIDE the build:
                            # the image fails to build if a test fails

# models live on the host, mounted read-only at /models
SNAP=/models/Qwen3-0.6B make docker-run                  # interactive chat
docker run --rm -it -v ~/models:/models:ro \
  -e GGUF=/models/Qwen3-0.6B-Q4_K_M.gguf -e PROMPT="hi" moty
```

Or with compose (services `qwen`, `gemma`, `glm`; the whole env-knob table
passes through from the host):

```bash
docker compose build
SNAP=/models/Qwen3-0.6B QBITS=8 docker compose run --rm qwen
MODELS_DIR=/data/llm GGUF=/models/model.gguf docker compose run --rm qwen
```

The image builds `make portable` (x86-64-v3 on amd64, armv8-a on arm64), so
it runs on any modern host of the same architecture; rebuild with
`--build-arg ARCH=native` for the fastest binaries on one specific machine,
and `--build-arg BASE=<mirror>/debian:bookworm-slim` behind a registry
mirror. A hard RAM cap composes naturally with the engine's own knobs:
`docker run -m 256m -e MICRO=1 ...`.

## SIMD

The shared kernels (contract in `c/hw/hw.h`) are selected at compile time by `-march`
(one `#ifdef` ladder, no runtime CPUID dispatch):

| Build | f32 kernel | int8 kernel |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `make portable` (x86-64-v3) | AVX2+FMA | AVX2 (maddubs) |
| `make portable-v4` (x86-64-v4) | AVX512F | AVX2 (v4 has no VNNI) |
| `make` / `ARCH=native` (x86) | AVX512F where present | +AVX512-VNNI on supporting CPUs |
| ARM (NEON baseline) | NEON | NEON; +dotprod (SDOT) with `ARCH=native` on supporting cores |

Quantized matmuls (`QBITS=8`) run the per-row Q8_0 scheme: activations are
quantized to int8 per row and the dot is pure integer (`dot_i8i8`). `IDOT=0`
selects the exact f32×int8 path instead — use it for byte-exact `REF`
comparisons (olmoe now shares the same int8 scheme, so its numerics also
shift slightly unless `IDOT=0`). The engines print the compiled tiers in
their startup banner (`idot ... | f32 ...`).

`make test-native` builds and runs the test suite with `-march=native`, so
the reference-based tests exercise the SIMD kernels your CPU actually has.

## Run

Each engine is driven by environment variables and reads a HuggingFace
snapshot directory (config.json + tokenizer.json + *.safetensors):

```
# one-shot prompt
SNAP=/path/to/Qwen3-4B PROMPT="Hello!" ./c/qwen

# interactive chat (persistent KV cache)
SNAP=/path/to/Qwen3-4B ./c/qwen

# GLM-5.2 (see the glm.c header for its full env reference)
SNAP=/path/to/glm-snapshot PROMPT="ciao" ./c/glm
```

Common environment variables (qwen engine):

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SNAP` | — | model snapshot directory (required) |
| `PROMPT` | — | one-shot prompt; if unset, interactive chat on stdin |
| `NGEN` | 256 | max new tokens |
| `CTX` | 4096 | context length |
| `TEMP` / `NUCLEUS` / `SEED` | 0.7 / 0.95 | sampling (TEMP=0 → greedy) |
| `CHAT_TEMPLATE` | 1 | wrap prompt in the model's chat format |
| `THINK` | 0 | Qwen3 thinking mode (0 pre-closes the think block) |
| `QBITS` | 0 | 8 → int8-quantize weights **and embeddings** at load (~4× less RAM); 4 → int4 layer weights with group-wise scales (~8× on layers; embeddings and lm_head stay int8 for quality) |
| `QGROUP` | 32 | int4 scale group size (multiple of 16; 0 → one scale per row). 32 matches the GGUF Q4_0 block |
| `THREADS` | — | cap the OpenMP team; overrides `OMP_NUM_THREADS`; applied before load |
| `MEM_GB` | — | RAM budget in GiB: layers beyond the budget stream from disk each step |
| `MEM_FRAC` | — | same budget as a fraction (0..1) of total physical RAM; `MEM_GB` wins |
| `MICRO` | 0 | 1 → micro-RSS mode (qwen only): **no** weights resident, minimum possible RAM; see below |
| `MICRO_DROP` | 1 | 0 → let streamed weight pages live in the OS page cache (faster, more memory charged to the process's cgroup) |
| `KV_BITS` | 0 | 8 → int8 KV cache with one scale per (kv-head, position): 4× less KV RAM/traffic (1.2 GB → 300 MB at 4B/4k ctx). Queries stay f32, so the quantization error is one-sided |
| `PREFILL_CHUNK` | 0 | feed the prompt to the model in blocks of ≤N tokens: caps prefill activation peaks (≈1.6 GB at S=4096 on 4B → tens of MB at N=256), **bit-identical** output. Off by default: with `MEM_GB` each block re-reads the streamed layers from disk |
| `GGUF` | — | single-file GGUF model instead of `SNAP` (qwen): weights, config and tokenizer all come from the file; see below |
| `REF` | — | ref.json with prompt_ids/full_ids for greedy validation |
| `TOKENS` | 0 | 1 → dump generated token ids to stderr |
| `TTA` | off | **experimental** test-time adaptation: `cache` (neural cache), `bias` (online logit bias) or `lora` (online low-rank lm_head adapter); see [docs/online-learning.md](docs/online-learning.md) |
| `TTA_N` / `TTA_LAMBDA` / `TTA_THETA` / `TTA_LR` | 2048 / 0.1 / 1.0 / 0.1 | cache size, mix weight (capped at 0.5), similarity temperature, bias/lora learning rate (lora defaults to 1e-3) |
| `TTA_RANK` | 4 | rank of the `TTA=lora` online adapter (capped at 64) |
| `LORA` | — | safetensors file (or dir) with LoRA adapters to load at startup (qwen only) |
| `TRAIN` | — | corpus.txt → run the LoRA fine-tuner instead of generating (qwen only, see below) |
| `TRAIN_CTX` / `TRAIN_STRIDE` / `TRAIN_EPOCHS` | 512 / CTX / 1 | training window, window stride, epochs |
| `TRAIN_LR` / `TRAIN_WD` / `TRAIN_CE_CHUNK` | 1e-4 / 0 / 32 | AdamW learning rate, weight decay, CE chunk size |
| `LORA_RANK` / `LORA_ALPHA` / `LORA_LAYERS` / `LORA_HEAD` | 8 / 2·rank / 4 / 0 | adapter rank, scale, how many top layers to adapt, train an lm_head adapter too |
| `LORA_OUT` | lora.safetensors | where the trainer saves the adapters |

`TTA` (qwen only, default off — zero cost when unset) adapts predictions to
the text being generated: the neural cache mixes in a distribution over
recently seen continuations, the bias variant runs closed-form SGD on a
persistent logit bias. Adaptation state is cleared on every context reset
and REF validation mode structurally bypasses it.

On startup the engines seed hot-thread OpenMP defaults (`OMP_WAIT_POLICY=active`
etc.) and re-exec themselves once so libgomp picks them up; any `OMP_`/`GOMP_`
variable you set yourself wins, and `MOTY_NO_OMP_TUNE=1` disables the whole
mechanism.

`MEM_GB`/`MEM_FRAC` (qwen and gemma) trade speed for memory: the engine keeps
as many layers resident as fit the budget (embeddings, norms and recurrent
state always stay resident) and re-reads the remaining layers from the
safetensors on every step, prefetching the next layer while the current one
computes. With `QBITS=8` the streamed layers are quantized on read and run
the same int8 kernel as resident ones (4× smaller scratch and disk traffic,
token output identical to fully-resident int8); at `QBITS=0/4` they run f32.
Token output is identical at any budget. Unset → everything resident. The
classic path never goes below embeddings + one layer of scratch; if your
budget is under that floor the engine tells you to use `MICRO=1`.

## GGUF

The qwen engine runs GGUF files directly — one file, nothing else needed:

```bash
GGUF=Qwen3-0.6B-Q4_K_M.gguf PROMPT="hi" ./qwen
```

Weights are indexed into the same loader the safetensors path uses (names
translated from the llama.cpp scheme), the config is synthesized from the
`<arch>.*` metadata, and the tokenizer comes from `tokenizer.ggml.*`
(byte-level BPE only — the Qwen family). Supported tensor types: F32, F16,
BF16, Q8_0, Q4_0 and the K-quants Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K (dequantized on load, then
requantized per `QBITS`). Special case: Q4_0 with `QBITS=4` is repacked
**losslessly** into the engine's group-wise int4 (same nibble encoding, same
32-element scale blocks) — you run exactly the bits that are in the file.
`REF=`, `MEM_GB`, `MICRO=1`, `KV_BITS` and LoRA adapters all work as with a
snapshot directory.

`MICRO=1` (qwen only) is the mode for **hard** memory limits (cgroup,
embedded): nothing of the model stays resident. Embedding rows are gathered
from disk per token, every matmul re-reads its matrix in constant-size 4 MB
chunks, and the lm_head streams the same way; with the default `MICRO_DROP=1`
each chunk is evicted from the page cache right after use, so the footprint
is only activations + KV cache + tokenizer. The context default drops to 256
(`CTX` still wins) because the KV cache is the last big allocation. Token
output is bit-identical to the resident f32 path. The price is honest: the
whole model transits from disk on *every* token, so decode speed is disk
bandwidth divided by model size (~1–3 s/token for a 4B model on NVMe).
Ballpark RSS: Qwen3-0.6B ≈ 100–150 MB, 4B ≈ 150–250 MB, dominated by KV and
tokenizer, not weights. Incompatible with `TRAIN` (which needs resident f32
weights); `LORA` adapters work (they are small and stay resident).

## Fine-tuning (LoRA)

The qwen engine ships a dependency-free LoRA fine-tuner (hand-written
backward pass + AdamW, `c/engines/qwen_train.h`). Set `TRAIN=` to a plain-text
corpus and the binary trains rank-r adapters on the top `LORA_LAYERS`
layers (q/k/v/o + gate/up/down, optionally the lm_head) instead of
generating, then saves them as a single safetensors file:

```bash
TRAIN=corpus.txt SNAP=$SNAP/Qwen3-0.6B/snapshots/<hash> \
  LORA_LAYERS=4 LORA_RANK=8 TRAIN_EPOCHS=2 ./c/qwen
LORA=lora.safetensors SNAP=$SNAP/Qwen3-0.6B/snapshots/<hash> ./c/qwen
```

Training v1 requires a dense Qwen3 checkpoint, f32 weights (`QBITS=0`) and
everything resident (no `MEM_GB`). Setting `LORA=` during training warm
starts from previously saved adapters; at inference `LORA=` works with any
mode (chat, `PROMPT`, `REF`) and quantization, and adapters with all-zero
B matrices are exact no-ops. Every adapter tensor in the file must match a
known name and shape or the engine refuses to start. The backward pass is
verified by a finite-difference gradient check over every adapter
parameter (`qt_grad_fd`).

## Qwen engine notes

`qwen` runs two architecture families from the same binary, selected by the
model's config.json:

- **Qwen3 dense** (0.6B–32B): GQA attention with per-head QK-RMSNorm, RoPE
  (theta from config), SwiGLU MLP, tied embeddings where the checkpoint uses
  them.
- **Qwen3.5 hybrid** (Qwen3-Next lineage, e.g. Qwen3.5-4B): `layer_types`
  mixes **Gated DeltaNet** linear-attention layers (recurrent state instead of
  a KV cache — memory does not grow with context) with **Gated Attention**
  full-attention layers (output gate, partial RoPE).

Memory: a 4B model needs ~16 GB RAM at f32; `QBITS=8` quantizes everything
including the embedding table (~4 GB, loaded chunk-wise so the peak never
spikes above the final footprint).
In chat mode the recurrent DeltaNet state is append-only: editing history
requires a full conversation reset (the engine does this automatically when
the context fills up).

### Validating against a reference (REF mode)

`REF=<file> SNAP=<snapshot> ./c/qwen` greedy-decodes and compares token ids
against a reference file, printing the match count (exit 0 on full match,
2 otherwise). The file format is plain JSON:

```json
{"prompt_ids": [151644, 872, ...], "full_ids": [151644, 872, ..., 785, 6722]}
```

`full_ids` must extend `prompt_ids`; the engine generates
`len(full_ids) - len(prompt_ids)` tokens greedily from `prompt_ids` and
requires an exact id-by-id match (f32 build). Produce the reference with any
tool that runs the original model — e.g. with `transformers`:

```python
tok = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(m); model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(m, torch_dtype=torch.float32)
ids = tok(prompt, return_tensors="pt").input_ids
out = model.generate(ids, max_new_tokens=24, do_sample=False, num_beams=1)
json.dump({"prompt_ids": ids[0].tolist(), "full_ids": out[0].tolist()}, open("ref.json","w"))
```

### Tokenizer parity (tok_oracle)

The test build also produces `c/tests/build/tok_oracle` — a corpus-scale
parity harness: `./tok_oracle <tokenizer.json> < cases.tsv` where each line
is `TEXT\tID,ID,...` (escapes: `\n \t \r \\`). Run it against ids produced
by the reference tokenizer before debugging model-level mismatches.

### Gemma engine notes

`gemma` runs the Gemma 4 text stack: sliding-window attention interleaved
with global layers (p-RoPE, optionally larger global head_dim), per-head
q/k/v RMSNorm, sandwich norms, GeGLU, optional KV-sharing / K=V / per-layer
embeddings — all config-driven. A few checkpoint conventions could not be
verified offline and sit behind loud probes (see VERIFY comments in
`c/engines/gemma.c`); on first run against a real snapshot, resolve any reported
tensor-name/shape mismatch, validate the tokenizer with `tok_oracle`, then
gate with REF mode. `GEMMA_NORM_PLAIN=1` switches the RMSNorm convention
from `(1+w)` to `w` if REF parity points at the norm.
